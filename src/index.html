                  Aphrodite, ancient Greek goddess of sexual love and beauty,
                  identified with Venus by the Romans. The Greek word aphros means
                  “foam,” and Hesiod relates in his Theogony that Aphrodite was
                  born from the white foam produced by the severed genitals of
                  Uranus (Heaven), after his son Cronus threw them into the sea.

                <p class="description second-paragraph">
                  Aphrodite was, in fact, widely worshipped as a goddess of the
                  sea and of seafaring; she was also honoured as a goddess of war,
                  especially at Sparta, Thebes, Cyprus, and other places. However,
                  she was known primarily as a goddess of love and fertility and
                  even occasionally presided over marriage. Although prostitutes
                  considered Aphrodite their patron, her public cult was generally
                  solemn and even austere.

                <p class="description third-paragraph">
                  Some scholars believe Aphrodite’s worship came to Greece from
                  the East; many of her attributes recall the ancient Middle
                  Eastern goddesses Ishtar and Astarte. Although Homer called her
                  “Cyprian” after the island chiefly famed for her worship, she
                  was already Hellenized by the time of Homer, and, according to
                  Homer, she was the daughter of Zeus and Dione, his consort at
                  Dodona.

                  Aphrodite, ancient Greek goddess of sexual love and beauty,
                  identified with Venus by the Romans. The Greek word aphros means
                  “foam,” and Hesiod relates in his Theogony that Aphrodite was
                  born from the white foam produced by the severed genitals of
                  Uranus (Heaven), after his son Cronus threw them into the sea.

                <p class="description second-paragraph">
                  Aphrodite was, in fact, widely worshipped as a goddess of the
                  sea and of seafaring; she was also honoured as a goddess of war,
                  especially at Sparta, Thebes, Cyprus, and other places. However,
                  she was known primarily as a goddess of love and fertility and
                  even occasionally presided over marriage. Although prostitutes
                  considered Aphrodite their patron, her public cult was generally
                  solemn and even austere.
