                  Aphrodite, ancient Greek goddess of sexual love and beauty,
                  identified with Venus by the Romans. The Greek word aphros means
                  “foam,” and Hesiod relates in his Theogony that Aphrodite was
                  born from the white foam produced by the severed genitals of
                  Uranus (Heaven), after his son Cronus threw them into the sea.
                </p>

                <p class="description second-paragraph">
                  Aphrodite was, in fact, widely worshipped as a goddess of the
                  sea and of seafaring; she was also honoured as a goddess of war,
                  especially at Sparta, Thebes, Cyprus, and other places. However,
                  she was known primarily as a goddess of love and fertility and
                  even occasionally presided over marriage. Although prostitutes
                  considered Aphrodite their patron, her public cult was generally
                  solemn and even austere.
                </p>

                <p class="description third-paragraph">
                  Some scholars believe Aphrodite’s worship came to Greece from
                  the East; many of her attributes recall the ancient Middle
                  Eastern goddesses Ishtar and Astarte. Although Homer called her
                  “Cyprian” after the island chiefly famed for her worship, she
                  was already Hellenized by the time of Homer, and, according to
                  Homer, she was the daughter of Zeus and Dione, his consort at
                  Dodona.

                  Athena, also spelled Athene, in Greek religion, the city protectress, 
                  goddess of war, handicraft, and practical reason, identified by the Romans 
                  with Minerva. She was essentially urban and civilized, the antithesis in many 
                  respects of Artemis, goddess of the outdoors. Athena was probably a pre-Hellenic 
                  goddess and was later taken over by the Greeks.
                </p>

                <p class="description second-paragraph">
                  She was the daughter of Zeus, produced without a mother, so that she emerged 
                  full-grown from his forehead. There was an alternative story that Zeus 
                  swallowed Metis, the goddess of counsel, while she was pregnant with Athena, 
                  so that Athena finally emerged from Zeus. Athena’s association with the acropolises 
                  of various Greek cities probably stemmed from the location of the kings’ palaces there. 
                  She was thought to have had neither consort nor offspring.
                </p>

                <p class="description third-paragraph">
                  In Homer’s Iliad, Athena, as a war goddess, inspires and fights alongside the Greek heroes; 
                  her aid is synonymous with military prowess. Also in the Iliad, Zeus, the chief god, 
                  specifically assigns the sphere of war to Ares, the god of war, and Athena. Athena’s 
                  moral and military superiority to Ares derives in part from the fact that she represents 
                  the intellectual and civilized side of war and the virtues of justice and skill,
                  whereas Ares represents mere blood lust.

                  Demeter was the Ancient Greek goddess of the harvest. 
                  She was a very important goddess to Ancient Greek people, 
                  who farmed a lot of their food. Demeter had a kind and beautiful daughter, 
                  called Persephone, who she loved very much. Persephone, like her mum, loved nature. 
                  One day she was walking in a beautiful meadow and gathering flowers to take home 
                  when a huge hole opened up in the ground. Hades – the God of the Underworld – arrived 
                  through the hole and captured Persephone. He wanted the lovely Persephone to be his wife. 
                  How do you think Persephone felt?

                  Demeter could no longer see her daughter and missed her hugely. She was so sad, it affected 
                  the harvest across Greece. Crops, fruit and nature all stopped growing. She went to Zeus, 
                  the king of the gods, to ask him to help get her daughter back from Hades. Zeus could see 
                  how Demeter’s sadness was affecting Earth and so he agreed to help her.

                <p class="description third-paragraph">
                  Zeus and Hades agreed that Persephone would have to spend six months in the Underworld, 
                  but that she could return to Earth for the other six months of the year. One month for 
                  every pomegranate seed. From then on, whenever Persephone was with Demeter on Earth, 
                  Demeter would be so happy and crops, fruit and plants would grow and flourish beautifully – 
                  but when she went back to the Underworld, to live with Hades for six months, 
                  the plants would stop growing entirely.

                  Amphitrite, in Greek mythology, the goddess of the sea, wife of the god Poseidon, 
                  and one of the 50 (or 100) daughters (the Nereids) of Nereus and Doris 
                  (the daughter of Oceanus). Poseidon chose Amphitrite from among her 
                  sisters as the Nereids performed a dance on the isle of Naxos. Refusing his 
                  offer of marriage, she fled to Atlas, from whom she was retrieved by a 
                  dolphin sent by Poseidon.
                </p>

                <p class="description second-paragraph">
                  Amphitrite then returned, becoming Poseidon’s wife; he rewarded the dolphin 
                  by making it a constellation. In works of art Amphitrite was represented either 
                  enthroned beside Poseidon or driving with him in a chariot drawn by sea horses 
                  or other fabulous sea creatures.

                  The Greek sea god Poseidon was initially supposed to marry Thetis, a sea nymph and 
                  sister of Amphitrite, but quickly backed out of the agreement after being told by 
                  the prophet Themis that any son Thetis would bear would be greater than his father. 
                  Poseidon first laid eyes on Amphitrite while she was dancing at low tide with her 
                  sisters on the isle of Naxos. He immediately fell in love with her and asked 
                  for her hand in marriage.
